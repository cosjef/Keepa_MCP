## Prerequisites

1. **Keepa API Key**: Sign up at [https://keepa.com/#!api](https://keepa.com/#!api)
   - Keepa requires a paid subscription with token-based pricing
   - Different endpoints have different token costs
   - Product history calls are more expensive than basic product info

2. **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the TypeScript code:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. You'll configure your Keepa API key in the Claude Desktop config (next section)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The MCP server accepts these environment variables (configured in Claude Desktop):
- `KEEPA_API_KEY` (required): Your Keepa API key
- `KEEPA_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY` (optional): Delay between requests in milliseconds (default: 1000)
- `KEEPA_TIMEOUT` (optional): Request timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000)

### Claude Desktop Configuration

**Location**: 
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Note**: If the file doesn't exist, create it. Some installations may have `config.json` instead - copy it to the correct filename:
```bash
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/config.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keepa": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/keepa_mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "KEEPA_API_KEY": "your_keepa_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace `/path/to/keepa_mcp` with your actual path and `your_keepa_api_key_here` with your Keepa API key.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: After making any changes to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file, you must completely close Claude Desktop (Cmd+Q on macOS or Alt+F4 on Windows) and restart it for the changes to take effect.

### **Grant MCP Server Permissions**

When you first start Claude Desktop with the MCP server configured, you'll see a permission dialog. Click **"Allow"** to grant the server access:

![Claude Desktop Permissions](screenshots/claude_permissions.jpg)

*You must grant these permissions for the Keepa tools to appear and function properly.*

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **If MCP tools don't appear in Claude Desktop:**

1. **Check Claude Desktop version**: Ensure you're running version 0.7.0 or later (MCP support required)
   - Click "Claude" menu ‚Üí "About Claude"

2. **Verify config file location and format**:
   ```bash
   # Check if file exists
   ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   
   # Validate JSON format
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

3. **Test MCP server manually**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/keepa_mcp
   npm run build
   KEEPA_API_KEY=your_key_here node dist/index.js
   ```

4. **Complete restart**: Force quit Claude Desktop (Cmd+Q) and relaunch

5. **Simplified config**: Try removing other settings and use minimal config:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "keepa": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/full/path/to/keepa_mcp/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "KEEPA_API_KEY": "your_keepa_api_key_here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Check for logs**: Look for error messages in Claude Desktop console or system logs

### **Common Issues:**
- **Wrong file path**: Ensure the path to `dist/index.js` is absolute and correct
- **Missing build**: Run `npm run build` after any code changes
- **Invalid JSON**: Use a JSON validator to check config file syntax
- **Missing API key**: Make sure `KEEPA_API_KEY` is set in the env section of your config

### **‚úÖ Verify MCP Server Connection**
Once you've configured everything and restarted Claude Desktop, you should see your Keepa tools available:

![Keepa Tools Available](screenshots/keepa-tools-available.jpg)

*The Keepa MCP server provides 10 powerful tools for Amazon marketplace intelligence, sales velocity analysis, and inventory management.*

If you see these tools in Claude Desktop, your MCP server is successfully connected and ready to use!

## üöÄ Quick Start Examples

**üí¨ How to specify:** Just mention the country in your request: *"Find deals in UK Amazon using Keepa"* or *"Check German marketplace for this product using Keepa"*

### **Understanding Price History Data Types**
When requesting price history, Keepa tracks multiple price points for each product. This helps you understand the complete pricing picture:

**Common Data Types:**
- **0: Amazon Price** - Official Amazon selling price
- **1: New Price (3rd party)** - Lowest new item price from marketplace sellers
- **2: Used Price** - Lowest used item price
- **3: Sales Rank** - Product's ranking in its category (lower = better selling)
- **16: Rating** - Average customer rating over time
- **17: Review Count** - Number of reviews over time  
- **18: Buy Box Price** - Current "Buy Now" price (most important for sales)

**üí¨ How to use:** Claude automatically selects the right data types, but you can be specific: *"Show me Amazon's official pricing vs marketplace pricing for this ASIN"* or *"Get sales rank trends for this product using Keepa"*

## Development

### Scripts
- `npm run build`: Build TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run dev`: Run in development mode with auto-reload
- `npm start`: Start the built server
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check`: Check TypeScript types

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

## Important Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- The server implements automatic rate limiting between requests
- Default delay is 1000ms between requests (configurable)
- Keepa has token-based rate limiting on their end

### Token Costs
- Each API call consumes tokens from your Keepa account
- Product history calls are more expensive than basic product info
- Monitor your token usage in the Keepa dashboard

### Error Handling
- Network errors are automatically retried
- API errors include token information when available
- All errors are gracefully handled and reported
